/*
What is a logarithm?

Logarithm is the counter to exponentiation

log2(8) = 3 ---> 2^3 = 8
log2(value) = exponent ---> 2^exponent = value

(Thankfully) we omit the 2 : log === log(2)

The binary logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value <= 1

Ex : 8 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 log(8) = 3

Logarithmic time complexity : O(log n)

O (log n) is second to O(1)

We'll find logarithmic time complexity
- searching
- efficient sorting
- recursion (space )
